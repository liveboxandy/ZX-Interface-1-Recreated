# ZX-Interface-1-Recreated
Sinclair ZX Interface 1 recreated with Sinclair Routing

This is Kicad 7 project of the Sinclair ZX Interface 1 that uses the same routing and PCB size as the orignal.
A raw board was scanned and the top and bottom side images were imported into Kicad. This gave the board outline 
along with the position of components and the track layout.
The schematic available from the Service Guide was then redrawn in Kicad and useed to recreate the PCB.
The Bill of Materials from the Service Guide was used to select suitable footprints.

This is the result of that exercise.
